# pseudoscript

Translates pseudo code in to CoffeeScript/JavaScript.

It's kind of magic...

### Status
Hack! Trying out the principles (natural language scripting) within the area of home automation since I see great potential there.
Haven't had time to document the principles yet but hope to flesh out this README soon.
  
  
### Video demo
The code is obviously there for you to view but since the demo is built around my personal Photon device (wifi microcontroller) you cannot run it yourself yet.
I've made a video demo, though!

Currently I can only parse one line at a time, which means I have to define which light I'm communincating with each time. Since the whole point of this project is to harness the power of scope in natural language (i.e. "turn on the light and set the brightness (of the light) to 100 and (set) the color (of the light) to green), soon you'll just have to specify the light once until you switch your attention to another light (lights here of course are just the very first objects I'm trying these principles on...)

Please excuse the corny music. It was added by my colleague, who was nice enough to film and edit the whole thing for me. Thanks, Johan!
