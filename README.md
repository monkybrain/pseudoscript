# pseudoscript

Translates pseudo code in to CoffeeScript/JavaScript.

It's kind of magic...

### Status
Hack! Trying out the principles (natural language scripting) within the area of home automation since I see great potential there.
Haven't had time to document the principles yet but hope to flesh out this README soon.
  
  
### Video demo
The code is obviously there for you to view but since the demo is built around my personal Photon device (wifi microcontroller) you cannot run it yourself yet.
I've made a video demo, though!

Please excuse the corny music. It was added by my colleague, who was nice enough to film and edit the whole thing for me. Thanks, Johan!
